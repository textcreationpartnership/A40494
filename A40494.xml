            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Sir, I begin then— Our truly <hi>Loyal Addreſs</hi> was moſt bravely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd indeed, almoſt tranſcending the power of a ſtrong belief; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in about three days time after 'twas Printed, there was above <hi>Ten thouſand</hi> truly <hi>Loyal Apprentices</hi> of <hi>London</hi> had Signed it, notwithſtanding thoſe three <hi>Monopolizers</hi> of Lyes, <hi>Benskins, Thompſon</hi> and <hi>Hodge,</hi> had miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented this Modeſt <hi>Addreſs</hi> to the whole <hi>World,</hi> deſigning to obſtruct it, though they will be ſooner able to put the <hi>

                  <hi>Oh Noble Pack of induſtrious ſtriplings indeed</hi> (if your Tongue hath ſpoke truth)! But we'l anticipate the progreſs of this affair, if we can; and were it it not for the ſweet thoughts of nipping your Addreſs in the Bud, before it be bloſſomed into maturity (or preſenting), our hearts would be wholly dejected, to think that the whole <hi>World</hi> will viſibly ſee that the far greater part of the <hi>Apprentices</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> dare not but dread the taking upon them the aſperſing of Parliaments. <hi>Ah Whigg! Millions</hi> of <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>cares</hi> therefore are hourly buzzing in our zealous and envious mind, to prevent you. And our <hi>Club,</hi> that meet every night at the <hi>Crown-Tavern</hi> in <hi>Ivy Lane,</hi> are reſolved to tare all the <hi>Addreſſes</hi> they can meet with throughout the whole <hi>City of London.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether or no you know not the <hi>Barber</hi> that was to have a Pot of Ale, for every 20. <hi>Hands</hi> he got to our late <hi>Addreſs</hi> to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> for which purpoſe he travelled the whole ſpace that interveneth between two Suns, from houſe to houſe; which having done, he ſits him down to enumerate his <hi>Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> and finding the <hi>Total</hi> but Seven, he conſiders, his labour in two days would not pay for one ſupper at night, and therefore by the help of his <hi>pregnant fancy,</hi> and more <hi>tempting invention,</hi> he writes in his Paper <hi>Threeſcore Names,</hi> and carried it into the <hi>Club,</hi> and had <hi>Three Pots of Ale</hi> for his pains: A noble <hi>ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,</hi> was it not <hi>Whigg,</hi> for two days labour and pains?</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:108354:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>My other <hi>Queſtion</hi> is this, whether or no you are not acquainted with the <hi>Printers Boy</hi> that had 2 <hi>d.</hi> a dozen for as many Names as ever he could poſſibly produce, and he produced abundance, and is now ready to atteſt that the greater part of them were Names of his own <hi>invention.</hi> But pray <hi>Country-man</hi> lock theſe things as a ſecret within your own breaſt, for fear of <hi>publick reflections.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Whigg.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, there's no need of <hi>ſecrecy</hi> here, for (were there, my tongue ſhould be cloſe Priſoner to my heart) alas this deceitful manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of yours was publickly known; and likewiſe 'twas as openly known, that to <hi>augment</hi> the number of your <hi>Subſcribers,</hi> you got all the <hi>Journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Carmen, Porters, Tapsters,</hi> you could procure in Town, with many others of a far more inferior degree: <hi>Quae nune preſcribere longum eſt.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>This <hi>Stratagem</hi> we took, as very well knowing that all perſons of ſuch an <hi>inferior rank</hi> and <hi>profeſſion,</hi> would eaſily be <hi>bribed</hi> to ſet there hands to that which their <hi>judgments</hi> approved not of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whigg.</speaker>
               <p>Well then, with all your <hi>ſlights</hi> and <hi>ſtratagems,</hi> how many real <hi>Subſcribers</hi> had you, with <hi>Apprentices, Journey men, &amp;c.</hi> and others, when your <hi>Addreſs</hi> was preſented? Come, Sir, <hi>tell me,</hi> and be ingenuous for once, and let your <hi>tongue</hi> and <hi>conſcience</hi> keep the ſame tune.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>I heard one of the <hi>Stewards</hi> of our <hi>Feaſt</hi> ſay, the number we had was but four thouſand at moſt, (which man I could name, <hi>VVhigg,</hi> only 'tis not good to be quoting of <hi>Authors</hi>), but I have heard others ſay (who dread an untruth) there was but five thouſand.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>And I pray, Sir, is it true (as is reported) that the grand <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters</hi> and <hi>preſenters</hi> of this <hi>Addreſs</hi> were not <hi>Apprentices,</hi> but perſons that live idlely out of a <hi>Calling,</hi> that feed on <hi>ſloth,</hi> as <hi>Beetles</hi> in the dung they breed in, not caring how the <hi>metal</hi> of their mind is eaten with the ruſt of <hi>idleneſs?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>That's an undoubted verity (and no <hi>Chimera</hi> of a reſtleſs brain, as ſome of our <hi>Tories</hi> aſſert) for ſome of them to me did declare, That the <hi>world</hi> could not go worſe with them than it did, let it go how it will.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whigg.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, then I perceive your under-hand proceedings you cannot deny; but <hi>Tory,</hi> I'le tell you, they have writ ſuch a <hi>deformity</hi> upon the <hi>faireſt brow of that undertaking,</hi> that <hi>Hodg, Thompſon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Benskins</hi> can never wipe off.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>What then! would you have me deny a plain truth? I cannot (I will not give my <hi>conſcience</hi> the lye.) And I know as for <hi>Hodge, Thompſon</hi> and <hi>Benskins,</hi> and all their <hi>Abettors,</hi> they may as ſoon <hi>kindle fire with ſnow,</hi> as prove me a lyar in what I have ſaid.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>VVhigg.</speaker>
               <p>I confeſs the truth is the truth, be it on which ſide it will, and at laſt <hi>Truths heart will ſhine through its breaſt.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot deny what you aſſert; but I pray, Sir, remember that an ill <hi>Comment</hi> may marr a good <hi>Text,</hi> and a <hi>miſinterpretation</hi> of our procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings (if <hi>publickly</hi> known) may mar our <hi>good meaning.</hi> I would therefore injoin you to conceal all I have told you ſince we came into this <hi>Arbor.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whigg.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I ſhall not be <hi>unmindful</hi> of your deſire, and do confeſs that the <hi>ſwifteſt wing of recompence is too ſlow to overtake thoſe civilities and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi> that now I have received from you. But, Sir, now our <hi>Masters buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> calling us at <hi>home,</hi> we will now lovingly part, and ſo for the preſent <hi>adjourn</hi> our Diſcourſe till <hi>fortune favour</hi> us with another <hi>fair opportunity.</hi> Only I pray reſolve me in one <hi>particular</hi> before we go, which is, Whether or no he was not the man that firſt ſet afoot your <hi>Addreſs</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> that went down on his <hi>marrow-bones</hi> before Sir <hi>George Waterman,</hi> and there hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly asked Mrs. <hi>S</hi>— forgiveneſs?</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rem acu tetigiſti.</hi> And ſo adieu.</p>

               <l>GO on Heroick Souls, and faithful be</l>
               <l>Unto your God, your King, your Liberty.</l>
               <l>Let your unbyaſt actions give the Lye</l>
               <l>To ſuch as ſcandalize your Loyalty.</l>
               <l>To <hi>Caeſar</hi> render what's to <hi>Caeſar</hi> due:</l>
               <l>Earth merits, Heaven expects no more from you.</l>
               <l>Thoſe Rights defend, which your brave Sires ſent down,</l>
               <l>Inviolable as the Throne or Crown.</l>
               <l>Tell ſupple Paraſites, and treacherous Knaves,</l>
               <l>You'r humble Subjects, not degenerate Slaves.</l>
               <l>Bow low, but ſcorn to creep (for that's as well).</l>
               <l>Nor for a Meſs of Broth your Birth-rights ſell.</l>
               <l>Paſs by th'affronts that Hell and <hi>Rome</hi> can ſend;</l>
               <l>Comfort your ſelves, When 'tis at worſt 'twill mend.</l>

               <l>Of Popiſh mercy never run the riſque:</l>
               <l>A Crowned Serpent grows a Baſilisk.</l>

               <l>The Cauſe is Heaven's, Heav'n will eſpouſe the Cauſe.</l>
               <l>Undauntedly prop up your Churches Walls,</l>
               <l>And joy to fall beneath it, if it falls.</l>
               <l>To periſh thus, who would not be content,</l>
